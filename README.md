# LeafSpeciesDetection

ML model to determine which species the plant, of the leaf in obeseration, is. Parameters such as petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width used. The dataset was extracted by sklearn library-iris.

This ML model is made by the Decision Tree algorithm with the accuracy of 96%

Libraries used:
1.DecisionTreeClassifier
2.load_iris

New things I learnt:
1.Decision Tree algorithm
2.max_depth value
